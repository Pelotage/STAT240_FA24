Students can access the raw files for homework 3 here. You will also need exoplanets-clean-through-2022.csv in your STAT240/data folder (https://github.com/cjones46/STAT240_FA24/blob/main/data/exoplanets-clean-through-2022.csv).

If you downloaded HW3 before noon on Friday 9/27, there is an error in Question 2: the "your first two rows should look like this" suggestion was incorrect. This has been fixed now.

Eventually, the solutions will be posted here as well.
