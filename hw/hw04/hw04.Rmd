# Preliminaries

- This file should be in `STAT240/homework/hw04` on your local computer.
- You should also download `education.csv` and `obesity.csv` to `STAT240/data` on your local computer.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
education_original = read_csv("../../data/education.csv")
obesity = read_csv("../../data/obesity.csv")
```

**The eventual goal of this assignment is to compare the obesity percentage in each zip code and sex with the college educated percentage. Both dataframes contain data on Wisconsin residents.**

# Problem 1

Every row of `education_original` represents a **zip code** within Wisconsin; a small-ish region that the Postal Office uses for mailing purposes.

`pct_f_bach` represents the percentage of female adults within that zip code that have a bachelor's degree.

`pct_m_bach` represents the percentage of male adults within that zip code that have a bachelor's degree.

```{r}
head(education_original)
```

The following chunk is provided for you.

```{r}
# Do not edit this chunk!
education_original %>% 
  summarize(w = n(),
            x = sum(pct_f_bach > pct_m_bach, na.rm = T),
            y = mean(pct_f_bach > pct_m_bach, na.rm = T),
            z = sum(is.na(pct_f_bach) & is.na(pct_m_bach)))
```

**What do each of these four quantities represent in real terms?** Do not use technical vocabulary. For example, if it was correct, you could write that "w is the percentage of zip codes in which at least half of female adults have a bachelor's degree." 

> `w` is... REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE

> `x` is... REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE

> `y` is... REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE

> `z` is... REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE

# Problem 2

Using `education_original`, create a **scatter plot** with `pct_f_bach` on the x axis and `pct_m_bach` on the y axis. There will be one point for each zip code.

Incorporate the following customizations:

* Add a straight, diagonal, red line with `slope = 1` and `intercept = 0` using `geom_abline()`.

* Improve the x and y axis labels.

```{r}
# Write your code here!

```

**What do points BELOW this red line (e.g. the bottom/right half) represent in real terms?** 

> REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE

# Problem 3

Our goal in this problem is to create a new dataframe called `education_long`. This dataframe will have the columns:

- `zip`
- `sex`: with values "female" and "male"
- `pct_bachelors`: The percentage of that sex within that zip code that has a bachelor's degree.

Here are the first few rows of the dataframe we're going for:

```
     zip sex    pct_bachelors
   <dbl> <chr>          <dbl>
 1 53001 male            13  
 2 53001 female          23  
 3 53002 male            16.2
 4 53002 female          25.4
```

---

The steps to generate this new dataframe are:

- Start with `education_original`,

- **Drop** any rows that have any missing data anywhere.

- **Pivot** the dataframe such that you have TWO rows per zip code; one for each sex within zip. (*Hint: We have one row per zip code in `education_original`, so the dataset is getting `longer`*)

- Make the **column names** after pivoting: `zip`, `sex`, and `pct_bachelors`. (This can be done either with a `rename()`, or with arguments within `pivot_longer()`.)

- Make the **values** of `sex` "female" and "male" rather than "pct_f_bach" and "pct_m_bach" using `case_when()`. (Alternatively, a slightly easier way could be to `rename()` the columns to `female` and `male` before pivoting; either way is acceptable.)

```{r}
# Write your code here

```

# Problem 4

Right now, the `obesity` data has one row for every zip-sex-age group combination; age groups are 5 years old - 17 years old, 18-34, 35-54, 55-74, and 75+.

We want to obtain a version of the `obesity` dataset we can merge with `education_long` above; so both datasets would have to have one row for every zip-sex combination.

This means we need to `summarize()` the obesity dataset to obtain one row per zip-sex combination, purposefully "smoothing over" all the age group detail we currently have.

The dataset we are trying to obtain will have the following first few rows:

```
     zip sex    total_pop total_obese_pop_estimate
   <dbl> <chr>      <dbl>                    <dbl>
 1 53001 female       726                     259.
 2 53001 male         755                     330.
 3 53002 female       977                     369.
 4 53002 male        1052                     404.
```

---

Create a new dataset called `obesity_summary` by executing the following steps:

- Start from `obesity`,

- **Remove** all rows with data about the youngest age group (05-17), since the `education_long` dataset is only about adults, so that would be an unfair comparison.

- Within each row, calculate **obese_percent** by taking `obese/n`. (`n` is the number of people we have data for; `pop` is the total population, so `obese/n` is just an estimate)

- Within each row, calculate **obese_pop_estimate** by taking `obese_percent * pop`.

- **Group and summarize** the data, such that you obtain one row per zip-sex combination (like in `education_long`), with the information:
    - Total population within that zip-sex combination: call this `total_pop`
    - Total obese population (estimated) within that zip-sex combination: call this `total_obese_pop_estimate`.
    
    - Note that you will have to use `na.rm = T` when summarizing to avoid NAs.
    
- **Remove** all rows where there are 0 estimated obese individuals. (*Bonus question: Why didn't we just do this at the beginning? Answer at the bottom of the question.*)

```{r}
# Write your code here!

```

*Answer to bonus question: We needed to know the `pop` from every single row to calculate total population of a zip-sex combo, even if there were no obese people in that row. If we would have cleared out the 0 obese rows early, we would have lost some population.*

# Problem 5

**Create** a new dataframe called `joined` by **joining** `education_long` and `obesity_summary` (note that their rows should match by `zip` and `sex` together) and *only keeping rows that match in both dataframes.*

Your first four rows of `joined` should look like this:

```
     zip sex    pct_bachelors total_pop total_obese_pop_estimate
   <dbl> <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>                    <dbl>
 1 53001 male            13         755                     330.
 2 53001 female          23         726                     259.
 3 53002 male            16.2      1052                     404.
 4 53002 female          25.4       977                     369.
```

*Hint: Just like we can `group_by(zip, sex)`, we can `join_by(zip, sex)`*.

```{r}
# Write your code here!

```

# Problem 6

Using `joined` from the previous problem,

Create a **scatter plot** of points with `pct_bachelors` on the x-axis and percentage obese on the y axis. *You will have to calculate percentage obese for this problem.*

Incorporate the following customizations:

- **Color** the points by sex.

- Improve the **labels** of the x axis, y axis, and legend.

- Add a **single** smooth line showing the trend of the data. (You should not have two different lines by sex!)

```{r}
# Write your code here!

```

What does this graph tell you about the relationship between college education rates and obesity rates?

> REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR RESPONSE

# Problem 7

Use `joined` to compute:

- The percentage of the entire Wisconsin adult population with a bachelor's degree
- The percentage of the entire Wisconsin adult population with obesity

Let these values **print as output**.

*Hint: You'll need to compute some other quantities along the way, including the number of people with a bachelors in each zip-sex, and the total Wisconsin adult population.*

```{r}
# Write your code here!

```

It is okay if one percentage is on the 0-1 scale and the other is on the 0-100 scale. You should get the following percentages:

```
  perc_bachelors perc_obese
           <dbl>      <dbl>
1           29.3      0.362
```

# Problem 8

Use `joined` to compute the same three metrics as the previous problem, but this time, within each group of `sex`.

Let these values **print as output**.

```{r}
# Write your code here!

```


You should get the following output:

```
  sex    perc_bachelors perc_obese
  <chr>           <dbl>      <dbl>
1 female           30.4      0.375
2 male             28.2      0.349
```
