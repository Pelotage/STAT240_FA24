# This is a level 1 header

### The is a level 3 header

A bullet list:

- first item
- second item
- third item

A numbered list:

1. first
2. second
4. third (notice how it automagically renumbers when you knit)

You can make text in *italics* by surrounding with single asterisks or in **bold** by surrounding with double asterisks.

Note, you ** cannot put spaces ** at the edges of what you wosh to format. If you do, the asterisks are just printed normally.

```{r}
# The hash makes comments inside of R chunks and headers outside of R chunks

2+2

# output appears in a separate box after you knit
```

## Create some variables

```{r}
a = 2
a + 2

a + b

b = c(2,3)

a + b

a*b
```
