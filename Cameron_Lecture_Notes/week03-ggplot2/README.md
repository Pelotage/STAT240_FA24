Cameron's week 3 notes on ggplot2 will go here. 

Note that these notes also require the download of ESPNExample.png, next to the .Rmd in STAT240/lecture/week03-ggplot2; and lake-mendota-winters-2023.csv, which is on GitHub in STAT240_FA24/data, and should be downloaded to STAT240/data on your computer; NOT the lecture folders.
